    "Often, sales representatives are required to go through call transcriptions to extract relevant details and manually enter them into Salesforce tables. This process is very time consuming. Using You.com's APIs, it's possible to automate the extraction of structured information from unstructured data like call transcripts. The following sections of the notebook demonstrates how the APIs can answer questions based on the transcript, and when there is not enough information available, the API can search through the web to find the most relevant answer."
