The company reported its fiscal first-quarter (FY 2025) earnings, which missed revenue consensus estimates, leading to a sharp decline of more than 20% in one day. This was the largest one-day loss for Salesforce in nearly 20 years. The disappointing earnings report has raised concerns among investors about the adoption curve and ultimate monetization of generative AI for software-as-a-service firms like Salesforce.\n",
