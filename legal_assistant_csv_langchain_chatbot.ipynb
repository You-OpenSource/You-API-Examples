United States\\n- **Citation**: 92 U.S. 105 (1876)\\n- **Decision**: The Supreme Court ruled that certain secret contracts could not be publicly reviewed by courts, thereby precluding judicial review in cases where success depends on the existence of a secret espionage relationship with the government.\\n- **Significance**: This case was an important precursor to the court's 1953 decision in United States v. Reynolds, which recognized the State Secrets Privilege. The ruling in Totten was later referenced and its holding expanded in the 2005 case of Tenet v. Doe and General Dynamics Corp. v. United States.\\n\\n### Further Reading:\\n- [Totten v. United States - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totten_v._United_States)\\n- [Supreme Court Opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/92/105/)\\n\\nThis case is pivotal in understanding the legal boundaries and protections involving espionage and economic espionage within the United States legal system.\""

It is one of the primary tools used to prosecute insider trading.\\n\\n2. **Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984**:\\n   - This act increased the penalties for insider trading, including civil fines up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided.\\n\\n3. **Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988**:\\n   - This law further strengthened the penalties and enforcement mechanisms for insider trading, including increasing the maximum prison sentence and fines.\\n\\n4. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002**:\\n   - While primarily focused on corporate governance and financial practices, this act also includes provisions to deter and punish insider trading.\\n\\n5. **Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010**:\\n   - This act includes provisions to enhance the SEC\\'s enforcement capabilities, including whistleblower incentives for reporting insider trading.\\n\\n6. **Rule 10b5-1**:\\n   - This rule provides a defense for individuals who can show that their trades were planned before they became aware of material non-public information.\\n\\n7. **Misappropriation Theory**:\\n   - This theory, accepted in U.S. law, states that anyone who misappropriates material non-public information and trades on that information in any stock may be guilty of insider trading.\\n\\n### Key Cases and Concepts\\n- **Classical Theory of Insider Trading**: Insiders who trade based on material non-public information or tip others who trade can be held liable.\\n- **Misappropriation Theory**: Extends liability to individuals who misappropriate information and trade on it, even if they are not traditional insiders.\\n\\n### Enforcement and Penalties\\n- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary agency responsible for enforcing insider trading laws.\\n- Violations can result in both civil and criminal penalties, including fines, disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.\\n\\n### Notable Legislation\\n- **Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984**: [Read the Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-98/pdf/STATUTE-98-Pg1264.pdf)\\n- **Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988**: [Read the Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg4677.pdf)\\n\\nFor more detailed information on insider trading laws and enforcement, you can refer to resources from the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov) and legal databases such as [Cornell Law School\\'s Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/insider_trading).'"

He made substantial profits from these trades.\\n\\n#### Legal Issue:\\n- The primary issue was whether O\\'Hagan\\'s actions constituted insider trading under the \"misappropriation theory.\"\\n\\n#### Supreme Court\\'s Decision:\\n- The Court upheld the \"misappropriation theory\" of insider trading.\\n- **Misappropriation Theory**: This theory asserts that a person commits fraud \"in connection with\" a securities transaction, and thereby violates Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.\\n- The Court found that O\\'Hagan\\'s conduct was deceptive because he misappropriated the information in violation of a duty owed to his law firm and its client.\\n- The decision expanded the scope of insider trading liability beyond traditional insiders (corporate officers, directors, and employees) to include those who misappropriate information.\\n\\n### Significance:\\n- **United States v. O\\'Hagan** is significant because it established and affirmed the misappropriation theory as a valid basis for prosecuting insider trading.\\n- It broadened the scope of who could be held liable for insider trading, thereby strengthening the SEC\\'s ability to enforce insider trading laws.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can read the full text of the [United States v.
