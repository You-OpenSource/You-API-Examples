For instance, beef and veal prices were 7.0% higher than in April 2023 due to tight supplies and strong demand.\\n\\n3. **Climate Events:** Adverse climate events, such as wildfires and flooding, affected harvests and contributed to higher food prices.\\n\\n4. **Geopolitical Factors:** Geopolitical conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East, also played a role by impacting global commodity prices, which in turn affected food prices.\\n\\n5. **Supply Chain Issues:** Ongoing supply chain disruptions continued to affect the availability and cost of food products.\\n\\nThese factors combined to drive up food prices in British Columbia in April 2024.'"
